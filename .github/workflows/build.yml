      # GHA's cache action does not run as sudo, but we're writing files inside
      # of docker, running as root, directly to the host. The cache tries to
      # extract the files, but then cannot write to directories owned by root.
      # chmod/chown fixes the issue, allowing the files to extract successfully.
